OpenAI's web interface for ChatGPT is a general purpose UI suitable for using
ChatGPT as a chatbot. When using ChatGPT for software development however, I
routinely find myself wishing that the chat UI had additional features. This
demo provides a UI designed specifically for more complex tasks like planning
new software features or debugging issues in code.

## Privacy Policy
This chat interface stores all its data in your browser's local storage.  Your
data is never sent to any external services other than OpenAI's GPT API
endpoints. OpenAI's privacy policy for the GPT API can be found under the
[API > Data Privacy](https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy) section on OpenAI's
site.

## API Key
An OpenAI API key with funds available is required to use this interface. Please
visit [https://platform.openai.com/](https://platform.openai.com/) to set up an
API key.

You are responsible for ensuring the security of your API key. The API key will
only ever be sent by this interface to OpenAI's GPT API endpoints and may be
optionally stored in your browser via local storage. The code for this interface
can be found on this site's
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/zkWildfire/whattf.how) under the
[`assets/scripts/ChatGptDevChat` folder](https://github.com/zkWildfire/whattf.how/tree/master/assets/scripts/ChatGptDevChat).

If you would like to test the devchat out using a lorem ipsum generator in
place of calls to the GPT API, use a dummy API key and select the "Lorem Ipsum"
LLM. Example dummy API key:  
```
sk-000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

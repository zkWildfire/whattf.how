The work on the modular neural networks project is my first attempt at a machine
learning project. It also will not be my last. To better accommodate future
projects, I've begun planning out how parts of the modular neural networks
project's code can be extracted into general purpose projects that I can reuse.

## Introduction
In software engineering, it's important to build reusable code where possible
since re-using existing, already tested code is a massive time saver. This means
making use of open source libraries where possible, and re-using your own code
too. I expect to be doing a lot more work in the future where I experiment with
various implementations for AI agents in a variety of environments, so a lot of
the work I'm doing now for the modular neural networks project will apply to
those projects too.

I'm currently in the early stages of the modular neural networks project, but
I already have some ideas for how I might generalize my code to support future
projects. This is more in the realm of software engineering than research or
machine learning, so I felt it might be useful to put my thoughts down on paper.
My hope is that others find it useful to learn what I look for and how I
approach generalizing code for potential future use when even I do not even know
what the future applications may entail.

Please keep in mind that at the time this post is being written, I am very early
on in the development of the modular neural networks project. As a result, it's
entirely possible that I may find that some component that I thought should be
generalized may end up being unnecessary for future projects, or may be too
specialized to be useful after being generalized. Such is the risk of trying
to generalize code without being fully aware of the requirements of future
projects that may use the code.

OpenAI's web interface for ChatGPT is a general purpose UI suitable for using
ChatGPT as a chatbot. When using ChatGPT for software development however, I
routinely find myself wishing that the chat UI had additional features. This
demo provides a UI designed specifically for more complex tasks like planning
new software features or debugging issues in code.

To use this chat demo, you will need to obtain and fund your own API key from
OpenAI. Please refer to OpenAI's documentation on how to generate an API key and
set up billing.

## API Key
An OpenAI API key with funds available is required to use this interface. Please
visit [https://platform.openai.com/](https://platform.openai.com/) to set up an
API key.

You are responsible for ensuring the security of your API key. The API key will
only ever be sent by this interface to OpenAI's GPT API endpoints and may be
optionally stored in your browser via local storage. The code for this interface
can be found on this site's
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/zkWildfire/whattf.how) under the
[`assets/scripts/ChatGptDevChat` folder](https://github.com/zkWildfire/whattf.how/tree/master/assets/scripts/ChatGptDevChat).

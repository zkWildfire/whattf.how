Initial progress towards my roadmap for the Modular Neural Networks project was
steady, but that section of the project relied entirely on classical code. Now
that I've reached the point where I need to add support for code that will later
be updated to be network-based, I'm finding that barging straight into this
project may not be ideal.

## Leaving? Why?
I've been writing code since 2009. During the early years of my programming
career, I was entirely self taught. As a result, I frequently ran into scenarios
that I didn't know how to handle. Back then, my response was generally to hit
the books and learn more about programming to figure out a way around whatever
obstacle I was running into. It's been a long time since I ran into an obstacle
like that, but I find myself back in this scenario with machine learning.

Rather that dive head first into continuing with the Modular Neural Networks
project, I'm taking a few steps back and focusing on the basics. I've been
working my way through old lectures from when I studied at UW to refresh myself
on various domains of mathematics, and I now plan on tackling small to medium
sized machine learning projects for practice. While I've worked with neural
networks in the past, they were all part of university assignments and it's been
years since I've touched ML-related code.

I plan on taking on smaller projects for a bit to gain familiarity with the
basics of machine learning. For simple projects like the MNIST handwritten
digits dataset, I plan on poking around with more experimental designs that
may influence my future work with modular neural networks. Similarly, I also
want to try taking on some Kaggle challenges to work my way up from trivial
challenges to intermediate level challenges.

## What's Next?
While I don't plan on making any posts in the Modular Neural Networks series
any time soon, I am certainly not abandoning my quest to get better with machine
learning! I am still extremely interested in doing research in the field of
machine learning in the future, and this brief detour is still taking me closer
to that goal.

In the meantime, expect to see new posts that cover the other projects I take on
to gain a stronger foundation with machine learning. These will likely be
post-mortem style posts where I talk about what went well and what went poorly
on a project, or perhaps progress update posts if a project is larger or takes
longer than expected. These will be tracked under a different series, and I'll
resume this series once I feel comfortable with my level of expertise in the
field of machine learning.

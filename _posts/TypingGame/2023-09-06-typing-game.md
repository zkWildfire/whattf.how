Back when I was a kid, I remember playing a game designed to help people get
faster at typing. This game is a custom implementation using the same concept
as that game but is designed for practicing foreign languages - Japanese, in
this case. Expect to see new vocabulary sets and possibly a few new game
features get added over time!

> Interested in seeing the source code for the game? The game's logic is written
> entirely in TypeScript and does not make use of any external frameworks. You
> can find the game's code in this repository's `assetss/scripts/TypingGame`
> folder on [GitHub](https://github.com/zkWildfire/whattf.how/tree/master/assets/scripts/TypingGame).

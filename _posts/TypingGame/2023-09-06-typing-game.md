Back when I was a kid, I remember playing a game designed to help people get
faster at typing. This game is a custom implementation using the same concept
as that game but is designed for practicing foreign languages - Japanese, in
this case. Expect to see new vocabulary sets and possibly a few new game
features get added over time!

## How to play
Once the game starts, characters will spawn at the top of the screen. Your goal
is to type the English characters that each Japanese character corresponds to
before the character(s) reach the bottom. For example, if you see the character
し, you'll need to type "shi" before it reaches the bottom. If a character
reaches the bottom, it'll deduct some of your lives and respawn at the top of
the screen.

Good luck and have fun!
